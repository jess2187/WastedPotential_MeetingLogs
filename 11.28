Stuff to be done:
Get adding assignments to work so that they can be displayed on the website

Joe
What was done this week?
Started actually coding the determineOptimalTimes function in index.js. 
This required me to get familiar with node.js and figure out how to access stuff from the database.
What did you have problems with? How will we address these problems?
Still a bit confused about how I will be assigning work times to the actual objects in the database.
I need to figure out and become more familiar with how node.js handles our db schema.
I also don’t exactly know how to break an assignment’s work time over multiple days.
What will be done by next week?
I will continue to work on and hopefully finish the algorithm code to determine optimal times.
