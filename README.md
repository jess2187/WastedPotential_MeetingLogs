# WastedPotential_MeetingLogs

This repository contains all of our meeting logs created during our team meetings throughout the semester. Each team member has a section in every log. Within their section, a team member will describe what they did that week, what they had problems with, and what they were going to work on the following week.

Team: Wasted Potential
We created a student calendar application. This app will run locally on someone's machine and help them schedule events, assignments, and classes. With our app, students will be able to input their preferred study times and assignments, and then have specific study periods scheduled for them. This will help students be more productive and complete their tasks in time. 
In the dashboard they'll be able to see a breakdown of the assignments and events they have that week, and in the calendar view they'll be able to see their whole month. After adding an assignment to their schedule, our application will prioritize the current list of assignments and fill in the student's preffered study times with work hours scheduled for inidividual assignments.
Events, assignment due dates, and assignment work times will all be different colors.

For instructions on how to run the application, head over to our code repository. More instructions will be in that README.
