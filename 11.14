Date Meeting
Stuff to be done

Joe
What was done this week?
I wrote a basic priority sorting algorithm in python (simply because Iâ€™m more familiar with it)
This gave me a basic framework for how the algorithm in node.js should work.
The python function took a list of lists that represented assignments and their due dates and number of hours it would take to complete them. It then gave them a priority and sorted the list based on this priority.
What did you have problems with? How will we address these problems?
I anticipate having a hard time learning how to implement this in node.js
Handling date objects is always hard, so I had to learn the syntax for parsing those.
What will be done by next week?
Next week I will begin implementing this algorithm in node.js
